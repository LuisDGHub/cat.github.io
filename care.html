        <h2>Essential Care Tips for Your Cat</h2>
        <p>Caring for a cat involves more than just feeding and providing shelter. To ensure your cat lives a healthy and happy life, here are some essential care tips:</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Feeding Your Cat</h3>
            <p>Proper nutrition is critical for a cat's health. A balanced diet suited to your cat's age, size, and activity level helps maintain a healthy weight and prevents medical issues. Always consult with your veterinarian to determine the best type of food for your cat, whether wet or dry food, or a combination of both.</p>

            <h3>Grooming</h3>
            <p>Regular grooming is essential, especially for long-haired breeds. Brushing your cat's coat helps prevent matting and reduces shedding. Some cats also require nail trimming and ear cleaning to stay comfortable and healthy.</p>

        <section>
            <h3>Regular Vet Checkups</h3>
            <p>Regular veterinary visits are important for maintaining your cat’s health. Schedule an annual checkup to monitor your cat’s overall well-being, including vaccinations, dental care, and parasite control.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Exercise and Play</h3>
            <p>While cats are often known for lounging around, they need mental and physical stimulation too. Interactive toys, scratching posts, and climbing structures will help keep your cat active and prevent boredom.</p>
