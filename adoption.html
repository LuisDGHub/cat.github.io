            <h3>Preparing Your Home</h3>
            <p>Before bringing your new cat home, ensure your space is safe and ready. This includes setting up a cozy bed, providing food and water bowls, and creating a litter area. Cats love hiding places, so make sure there are spots for them to retreat to if they need some alone time.</p>

            <h3>Adopting a Senior Cat</h3>
            <p>While kittens are adorable, senior cats make great companions too! They tend to be more relaxed and settled, which may be ideal for someone who prefers a calmer pet. Plus, many senior cats are in need of homes and can offer just as much love and affection as a younger cat.</p>
